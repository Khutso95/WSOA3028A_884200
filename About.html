      <h2>About Shepherd</h2>
      <p>
        Shepherd Modisha is a tech entrepreneur and investor from GaModisha, a
        village just outside Polokwane in Limpopo, South Africa. His father died
        when he was only twelve years old, an event that continues to define big
        parts of his life to this day. He grew up one of two kids in a
        middle-class family headed by his father, Ezekiel “Pretty Easy” Modisha,
        a talented mechanic and controversial car spinning extraordinaire.
      </p>
      <p>
        Under the guidance of his mother, Elizabeth "Professor Lizzy", Shepherd
        became an even better spinner himself, known in the spinning circles of
        Johannesburg as Herd Boy because of his rural roots. Growing up in a
        poor community, he witnessed first-hand the financial realities of many
        South Africans, he founded Randalas along with his friend Nare Phala,
        they later sold the company and he founded Shepherd’s Eye almost
        immediately after the sale and he continues to lead that company today.
      </p>
      <h4>Randalas</h4>
      <p>
        Randalas is a financial technology company specialising in microloans
        and risk management artificial intelligence aimed at high-risk
        individuals and enterprises. Shepherd came up with the name by adding
        Rand to Mandela after it was announced that the banknotes would bear
        Nelson's face. Shepherd was the Chief Engineer of the company aimed at
        the majority of poor South African excluded by the formal banking
        sector. The company was sold in what remains the biggest acquisition of
        a fintech start-up in the history of South Africa. He used his newly
        gained capital to fund Shepherd's Eye.
      </p>
      <h4>Shepherd’s Eye</h4>
      <p>
        After his unexplainable escape and father’s death from a car accident,
        Shepherd made it his mission to eliminate car accidents on the road. His
        best solution is Shepherd’s Eye, a company that designs and builds
        autonomous car capabilities and computer vision technologies. Shepherd’s
        Eye is one of very few companies in the world that vowed to never use
        lidar technology in their self-driving car packages, a decision he still
        has to defend to this day.
      </p>
      <h4>Other Interests</h4>
      <h5>Motorsport</h5>
      <p>
        Shepherd began spinning cars at the age of thirteen, by the time he was
        seventeen he could compose a song using hot wheels and a screaming
        engine and leave the body no choice but to dance. After he arrived in
        Orlando, Soweto, a place his parents used to dominate, he was told he
        could never be better than his legendary mother-father duo and that’s
        when he stepped on the pedal with his flashy sister as a stuntwoman.
        They won the Johannesburg Spinning Championship a record six times.
      </p>
      <h5>Investing</h5>
      <p>
        Shepherd holds a diversified investment portfolio consisting of
        companies in telecommunications, Energy, Genetics, Automotive Industry
        and Motorsports. He never sees himself as an investor, but he put his
        money into these companies because he cannot afford to put his time,
        these fields are important to his vision.
