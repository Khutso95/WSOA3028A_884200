        Shepherd Mampuru Modisha is a tech entrepreneur and founder of
        Johannesburg based autonomous vehicles software company Shepherd’s Eye.
      </p>
      <br />

      <h3>Early Life</h3>

      <p>
        Shepherd was born on the 7th of April 1992 to flamboyant and legendary
        car spinners Ezekiel and Elizabeth Modisha in the village of GaModisha,
        15 kilometres outside Polokwane, Limpopo. He grew up with his older
        sister Naledi in a middle-class family. The two siblings grew up
        competing against each other in everything from sports to video games,
        academics to motorsports. This is not by accident, it’s a culture
        carefully cultivated by their parents who were also fierce competitors
        on the streets in their Gusheshes
      </p>
      <p>
        Shepherd began his formal education at Leboa primary School, he showed
        above average intelligence but was not much different to his peers. His
        competitive culture gave him an edge over other kids in sports and
        earned him a few medals in the process. He left Leboa for Dinaledi
        Secondary School at the age 12 and that was a particularly difficult
        year for Modisha family.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the evening of the 20th of July 2004, Ezekiel “Pretty Easy” Modisha
        was tragically killed when his BMW 325i was hit on the driver's side by
        a minibus taxi killing him instantly. He was on his way home from
        collecting his son from a soccer game in Polokwane. In what can only be
        described as a miracle, Shepherd who was in the passenger seat came out
        of the car without a scratch, at least not a physical one. The sequence
        of events tortured Shepherd for years, seeing blood and glass shrapnel
        and immediately going blank whenever a Toyota Siyaya passed by. He
        blamed himself for his father’s death and his violent outburst at school
        landed him in police stations and his mother in tears on multiple
        occasions. His grades dropped dramatically but with the help of
        counselling and the two most powerful women in his life, he managed to
        forgive himself and use his loss as a fuel which would eventually land
        him in his current position.

      <h3>Family History</h3>
      <img src="images/BMW.jpeg" alt="BMW E30" />
      <p>
        To understand the Modisha family today, you must understand the five
        years between 1987 and 1992 that's when the legend of Pretty Easy and
        Professor Lizzy was born. The two shared love for performance art and
        met at the Soweto Theatre after a play written by Elizabeth was staged.
        Ezekiel was a world-class car mechanic who just opened shop recently, he
        was also a skilled driver and used his skills to impress the young
        writer who stole his heart. The two became inseparable, and Elizabeth
        quickly picked up the driving skills too. What turned the two lovebirds
        into township celebrities was the raising culture of spinning cars,
        which was lead by gangsters to show off their merchandise.
      </p>
      <p>
        After stealing cars, gangsters would bring them to Ezekiel's shop to
        give them a new look, to him, it was just business in a brutal
        environment and not aiding a criminal enterprise. One day, by chance,
        Ezekiel showed his patrons he could spin their cars better than they
        could and they began asking him to do it more often. His girlfriend, a
        wordsmith with a flair for the theatrics thought turning the whole thing
        into an art performance was a better idea. And that’s how she pioneered
        stunt-spinning with herself as the main attraction. Their street
        performances attracted large crowds from all over the township. The
        nickname "Pretty Easy", comes from his shortened name Eze, and was
        inspired by the shiny cars coming out of his shop and his record of zero
        scratches during extreme performances.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Professor Lizzy” was a homage to her academic prowess, she was a gifted
        writer and, on the streets, a skilled driver and impressive stunt
        performer. Their exploits are still the talk of the town to this day
        even after they left Soweto, but their gang affiliation and legal drama
        that surrounded them is now following their son.
      </p>
      <h3>High School and University</h3>
      <img src="images/High School.JPG" width="400" alt="high Scool Picture" />
      <p>
        High school was a fertile ground for the young Shepherd, he chose
        Mathematics and Science as majors while experimenting with computers at
        home. However, the most exciting experiment he was conducting at the
        time was that of girls. In the classic high school competition of dating
        the most popular girl, Shepherd had an unfair advantage, his sister, a
        traitor who broke girls-pact and revealed all top secretes.
      </p>
      <p>
        With the bag secured in the field of interpersonal relationships, he
        turned his attention to schoolwork and various competition. He was an
        excellent student averaging between 80 and 87% in class. Shepherd
        started the robotics club in his school to compete in the Innovation
        Expo, a prestigious competition in the field of software and technology.
        Due to lack of resources, the club relied on the community for support
        and they eventually won the competition in teams and individual
        categories.
      </p>
      <p>
        The university years were both difficult and exciting, just like many
        students from rural schools he struggled to make it to the top of the
        academic hierarchy, becoming a B student. What made him stand out were
        his extracurricular activities, he drove between Braamfontein and Soweto
        to take part in drifting competitions and he won the Intervarsity
        Business Competition with an idea about a financial product for the
        unbanked. In his second year of electrical engineering, he started
        working on what we now know as Randalas.
      </p>
      <h3>Randalas</h3>
      <p>
        With one in every six working South Africans working in the informal
        sector and a 29% unemployment rate, the number of unbanked individuals
        in the country make a compelling business case. The social and economic
        case is even bigger, as a small business owner coming from a township or
        rural area looking for a loan to grow your business, the traditional
        banks will not take your house as collateral and will consequently
        reject your application. That is one of the many reasons making you a
        high-risk individual, you have no assets in the eyes of traditional
        banks.
      </p>
      <p>
        To solve this problem, Shepherd and his friend Nare Phala decided to
        build business profiles for all major townships using government
        databases, consumer reports, social media and of course studying these
        places in person. They then used artificial intelligence and all this
        data to calculate risk when businesses from these areas made loans.
      </p>
      <p>
        For personal loans what they did was simple and ingenious, they
        decentralised loan sharking, which is very well established in poor
        communities. This is how the market worked: you ask a loan and anyone
        within a few kilometres radius can borrow it to you. This reduced
        chances of non-payment because the participant knew each other, and
        disputes because there was a third party involved.
      </p>
      <p>
        With profiles of all townships in Johannesburg, Pretoria, Cape Town,
        Durban and Polokwane, Randalas was sold to a major bank and continues to
        grow.
      </p>
      <h3>Shepherd’s Eye</h3>
      <p>
        Shepherd’s Eye is on the verge of becoming the most disruptive company
        in the automotive and transport industries, this, according to Shepherd,
        is the reason why he suddenly has many legal problems and old cases
        resurfacing. The company has been developing self-driving capabilities
        for cars and taxis for six years now. The company claims to be close to
        a
        <a
          href="https://www.driveit.co.za/rating-systems/autonomous-driving-levels-0-to-5-whats-the-difference/"
          target="_blank"
          >Level 5</a
        >
        autonomy, thanks to 5G which enabled more data to be processed.
      </p>
      <p>
        The autonomous package from Shepherd's Eye is designed to be compatible
        with all car brands, so in theory, any car owner can leave their
        steering wheel within the next six-seven months. The company currently
        has the system in 5000 cars and taxis on the road, collecting data and
        training its Artificial Intelligence.
      </p>
      <h3>Legal Troubles</h3>
      <img src="images/hand cuffs.jpg" alt="police handcuffs" />
      <p>
        Recently the Witwatersrand Post published a scathing
        <a href="Article1.html" target="_blank">article</a> alleging that
        Shepherd was arrested for public endangerment. In 2010 the 18-year-old
        Shepherd was arrested with his sister Naledi for drag racing on the N1
        highway. This was not a random or spontaneous event, it’s a family
        tradition pioneered by their parents in the late eighties to resolve
        once and for all who was the better driver. The case against the
        siblings disappeared and they were never charged.
      </p>
      <p>
        Shepherd was arrested multiple times for violence and assault, he was 15
        at the time and his defence argued that he was suffering from a
        post-traumatic stress disorder due to a car accident which ultimately
        killed his father, he won the case and his records were sealed because
        he was a minor. But what is bringing all these cases to light is the one
        allegation threatening to bring Shepherd down and decimate his support
        from both investors and die-hard fans. The Witwatersrand Post claims
        that Shepherds Eye is powered by stollen German technology, Shepheard
        allegedly used his driving skills and leveraged his proximity to
        township gangs in the drifting community to highjack the CEO of
        Nightlight, a German military contractor when he visited Johannesburg in
        2010.
      </p>
      <p>
        The municipal manager of the City of Johannesburg Kamogelo Kau has
        called for a probe into Shepherd’s Eye, and taxi boss Sipho Dlamini and
        the head of the National Workers Union Nkosinathi Khumalo announced that
        they have opened a criminal case against Modisha after consulting their
        lawyers.

      <h3>Personal Life</h3>

        alt="Shepherd and his sister Naledi"
      />
      <p>
        Although he seems to surround himself with all kinds of women, Shepherd
        is known to love older ladies. He’s been dating Rethabile Mokwena on an
        on-off basis, a woman 8 years his senior. She’s a fierce and aggressive
        lawyer who founded the Johannesburg based security consulting company,
        Florence, which is now responsible for 70% of cash transit cars in
        Gauteng.
      </p>
      <p>
        Shepherd’s best friend and reliable ally is his sister, just 4 days ago
        (13 April 2020) she announced on social media that she will be taking 9
        months unpaid leave from her job to join Shepherd’s Eye as Chief
        Operations Officer. This coincides with Shepherd's legal problems and
        the fast-approaching product launch of his company. The two have been
        close from a young age and according to their mother, since they could
        effectively communicate with each other.
