            <h3>Shepherd’s Eye Built on Stolen German tech? (3 of 3)</h3>
            <article>

            <p>I understand that perception is reality, so, let me clarify. To understand why I would agree to commit an apparent
            crime, you must first know what happened at that dinner I asked to have with the lawyer. Although she blackmailed me, I
            was attracted to her, and I was there to try my luck and to make my position clear. I was perfectly okay driving above
            the speed limit, but I would never agree to a crime she was proposing.</p>

            <p>She told me that although she was a qualified lawyer, she joined the military and as part of the training they were
            given the assignment to expose security flaws in any military structure with a small budget and very limited resources,
            it had to be an operation that could be carried out by civilians aided by at most two military personnel. She figured
            the security vulnerabilities of our defence lies in the exchange between the military and contractors. She effectively
            asked me to help her complete a school assignment, and after she briefed me on all the risks and benefits, I agreed and
            signed a bunch of papers of non-disclosure and consent.</p>

            <p>Mr X, who the Witwatersrand Post got the story from was not privy to this information because he was not going to be
            inside the base. He told the newspaper what he knew, but what he had was an incomplete picture and the Post should not
            have been quick to put it in print. But no, they are chasing the headline and I will be taking legal action.</p>

            <p>Now the question is, am I using Nightlight’s superior night vision technology for Shepherd's Eye's self-driving car
            project? Yes, I am, and this was never in the public domain because of the agreement I had with the Research Division of
            the SANDF and Nightlight. It is not unheard of for a military technology to be used for civilian purposes, the Internet
            is probably the most famous example. Having said that, we use our software to interpret and act on what the cameras pick
            up. They may have built the eye, but the brain is ours.</p>

            <p>Kelly Williams also mentions the fact that I was arrested multiple times as a teenager, she uses this in a desperate
            attempt to establish a pattern of criminality on my part. Yes, I was arrested a few times, but it was for schoolyard
            fights every boy goes through and it was a particularly difficult period for me after my father’s death. She even goes
            as low as trying to tie all these to a very big problem in our country, that is gender-based violence. She did this
            simply to evoke negative emotions and demonise me. This is the type of opportunistic and poor journalism we must address
            if we want to address real problems in our country. Some issues must be approached with seriousness, care and respect,
            our mothers and sisters are being abused and brutally murdered every day, yet a journalist will mention this in passing
            just for political expedience.</p>

            <p>She also claims that I am driven by anger and not vision, that would not be such a problem. Everyone should be angered
            by how many lives are lost on our roads and the type of driving practised by taxi drivers. Having said that, Kelly is no
            position to tell what drives me, she is not a psychologist or psychic and most importantly, she is not me.</p>
