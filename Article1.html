    <h2>Shepherd’s Eye Built on Stolen German Tech</h2>
    <article>
      <p>By Kelly Williams</p>

      <p>
        Tech multi-millionaire and founder of Shepherd’s Eye Mampuru Shepherd
        Modisha has been selling himself to the public as a visionary tech
        messiah, who is going to lead us out of the iron age and into the
        promised land. A world with cheap public transport and no car accidents,
        a world of convenience, safety and higher productivity. This dream that
        many South Africans are excited about could be a well-executed script of
        deception aimed at disguising the origins of Shepherd’s Eye, a company
        powered by stollen German technology according to a source who
        participated in the crime.
      </p>
      <p>
        I visited the source in prison who is serving time for an unrelated
        crime. He claims to have been part of a group coordinated by an unknown
        woman. Every member of the group was specialised, he and Shepherd were
        brought in as drivers. His role was to collect a package from Shepherd
        in Pretoria and deliver it to another man in Johannesburg. The following
        are extracts from our conversation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Kelly: What makes you sure that what you stole is what’s used by Mr
        Modisha?
      </p>
      <p>
        Mr X: I did not know that until recently, I did not even know what we
        had stolen at first. We were not supposed to know. But before delivering
        it, I looked at the package, binoculars! I have been taking classes here
        in prison, and two months ago I picked up a magazine about the military.
        In the tech section they showed the same binoculars we stole: it turns
        out this is the most advanced night vision goggles there is, I read the
        specs and they are exactly the same as those listed on Shepherd's Eye
        for their self-driving technology, you do the math.
      </p>
      <p>
        I asked our tech analyst to asses these claims, and after studying the
        two technologies he agreed that they were too similar to have been
        developed separately and independently. So if Shepherd lied about the
        foundations of his company, what else is he lying about? It is worth
        noting that Modisha was arrested multiple times when he was a teenager.
        In one of his recent cases, the docket disappeared, and he never stood
        trial. There are unproven allegations about him being violent. A man who
        wields this much power and always surrounded by women, it is hard not to
        be concerned given the rise in gender-based violence in our country.
      </p>
      <p>
        I personally believe that this matter should be investigated by relevant
        authorities. Modisha is not driven by vision but by anger, his father
        was killed in a collision with a taxi and Shepherd vowed to “eliminate
        every fool on a steering wheel of a taxi”. He is doing that by
        automating away their jobs.

      <p>This is still a developing story.</p>
