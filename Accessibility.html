                The day before writing this blog an eye opening coincident happened to
                me. I took out my phone and it was displaying everything in black and
                white. After restarting it, nothing changed, and I got frustrated trying
                to fix it. As a true member of my generation I did the right thing,
                searched for answers on the internet. It turns out its an operation mode
                designed for people with colour-blindness. Something I considered
                frustrating is a life saver for someone else and on the same day our
                lecturer said a lot of things about accessibility but what stood out for
                me was this: “Your design decisions are political statements” and
                suddenly my perspective changed.
              </p>
            
              <p>
                The internet is a revolutionary tool in every segment of our society and
                maybe more so for students, academics, researchers, activists and
                politicians. Given the importance of the World Wide Web in the modern
                world, it is important that we remove access barriers for all members of
                our society including people with disabilities. Access to the internet
                is becoming a basic human right, just like access to electricity or
                clean water and some progressive government around the world are
                declaring it a crime to design websites without necessary accessibility
                tools.
              </p>
            
              <p>
                Currently in South Africa there’s debate between telecommunications
                regulatory body, the Independent Communications Authority of South
                Africa (ICASA), telecommunications companies, the public and the
                government. The debate is about high costs of data bundles, the movement
                DataMustFall was born out of this. ICASA says phone companies must
                reduces prices, phone companies say the government must release more
                spectrum and the government say phone companies are simply greedy. In
                the meantime, the rest of us struggle to access the internet once we
                leave free Wi-Fi at universities. So, access is not simply a problem of
                web developers and robust design, it’s about infrastructure and
                socio-economic status.

                I will conclude by pleading with developers to follow the ethical
                guidelines provided by W3C in the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines
                2.0. The four principles of WCAG 2.0 are:
