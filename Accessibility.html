        The day before writing this blog an eye opening coincident happened to
        me. I took out my phone and it was displaying everything in black and
        white. After restarting it, nothing changed, and I got frustrated trying
        to fix it. As a true member of my generation I did the right thing,
        searched for answers on the internet. It turns out its an operation mode
        designed for people with colour-blindness. Something I considered
        frustrating is a life saver for someone else and on the same day our
        lecturer said a lot of things about accessibility but what stood out for
        me was this: “Your design decisions are political statements” and
        suddenly my perspective changed.

        The internet is a revolutionary tool in every segment of our society and
        maybe more so for students, academics, researchers, activists and
        politicians. Given the importance of the World Wide Web in the modern
        world, it is important that we remove access barriers for all members of
        our society including people with disabilities. Access to the internet
        is becoming a basic human right, just like access to electricity or
        clean water and some progressive government around the world are
        declaring it a crime to design websites without necessary accessibility
        tools.

        Currently in South Africa there’s debate between telecommunications
        regulatory body, the Independent Communications Authority of South
        Africa (ICASA), telecommunications companies, the public and the
        government. The debate is about high costs of data bundles, the movement
        DataMustFall was born out of this. ICASA says phone companies must
        reduces prices, phone companies say the government must release more
        spectrum and the government say phone companies are simply greedy. In
        the meantime, the rest of us struggle to access the internet once we
        leave free Wi-Fi at universities. So, access is not simply a problem of
        web developers and robust design, it’s about infrastructure and
        socio-economic status.

        I will conclude by pleading with developers to follow the ethical
        guidelines provided by W3C in the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines
        2.0. The four principles of WCAG 2.0 are:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><p>Perceivable</p></li>
        <li><p>Operable</p></li>
        <li><p>Understandable</p></li>
        <li><p>Robust</p></li>
      </ul>
