    <h3>What is a browser</h3>

        What is a browser? Before I attempt to answer this question, I will do
        what elementary school maths taught me, start with what you know. I have
        been learning how to code for the past two years, I completed projects
        in different programming languages, C++, C#, MATLAB and Python. All
        these languages are what is referred to as high-level languages. They
        were designed to be understood by humans, I mean the difference between
        these languages and your language is like the difference between
        Mathematics and English. But computers cannot understand them, computers
        use Machine Language, ones and zeros, they need an interpreter. That’s
        where a Compiler comes in.
      </p>

      <p>
        A compiler is a computer program transforms source code written in a
        programming language into executable machine language code. I never
        appreciated the compiler until I had to write code in Assembly language,
        suddenly I had to think about the underlying hardware architecture and
        how it is all wired. How many registers? How many bits? What is the
        frequency of the program counter? How much memory and where is located?
        Now for every line I write I must consider a hundred other things. How
        is all this relevant to a browser? In my opinion, a browser is to us
        what a compiler is to a machine. Servers, computers and humans
        communicate in different languages and a browser is there to simplify
        that process.
      </p>

      <p>
        A browser is computer application that runs on an internet connected
        computer and allows users to view and navigate Web pages, images, videos
        and other media such as games. Browsers uses HyperText Transfer Protocol
        (http or https for secure connections) to display HyperTect Markup
        Language files which are connected through hyperlinks and located with
        Uniform Resource Locator.
      </p>

      <p>
        When you enter the URL https://www.shepherdmodisha.com/myblog.html in
        the address line, the browser breaks it into segments:
      </p>

      <p>https: the secure internet protocol.</p>

      <p>
        www. shepherdmodisha.com : The location or server where the file will be
        found. The browser converts this into an IP address and determines which
        port to connect to before it can connect to the server
      </p>

      <p>
        myblog.html: The name of the file you’re trying to open. Once the
        communication between the server and browser is established, a page
        which is written in HTML is opened
      </p>
      <p>
        Browsers are designed to simplify web navigation, so even if you just
        type in shepherdmodisha.com, it will still know the protocol and find
        the type of file on the home page of the address. Before the invention
        of World Wide Web, HTTP(S) and URLs, finding what you are looking for on
        the internet was a pain, basically you had to be a genius who understood
        what those string of numbers senseless letters meant. What server? What
        port? What type of file? I imagine people who experienced that
        appreciate the browser like I appreciate compilers and high-level
        programming languages.
