        <h3>Who is Shepherd</h3>
        <p>Author: Khutso Nkadimeng</p>

        <p>Shepherd Modisha is an angel investor and founder of 
            Shepherd’s Eye, a company focused on developing autonomous 
            vehicles and computer vision technologies. This project is a 
            long-life mission inspired by tragic loss of his father to a 
            car accident 14 years ago.</p>
        <p>Born on the 7th of April 1994, Shepherd is an eccentric and 
            ambitious tech entrepreneur from GaModiša just outside 
            Polokwane in Limpopo. Coming from a middle-class family 
            he was exposed to computers at an early age, a rare occurrence 
            in his neighbourhood. His entrepreneurial and technical 
            abilities showed in his early teen years when he started a 
            successful robotics club in high school. After completing 
            his studies in Electrical Engineering, he joined forces with 
            his friend to start fintech company specialising in artificial 
            intelligence to reduce high risk associated with lending money 
            to low income individuals and businesses. He sold the company 
            for millions to a big bank before founding Shepherd’s Eye</p>
        <p>Interestingly, Shepherd had a dream of becoming a 
            professional race car driver one day. An unlikely hobby 
            given how his father died, but he was inspired by street 
            drifters in the townships and idolised Formula One champion 
            Michael Schumacher.</p>
        <p>Dr John Gray says Men Are from Mars and Women Are from Venus 
            in his bestseller of the same tittle and in that context, 
            Shepherd has visited Venus on multiple occasions. He grew 
            up in a house with two women, his mother and sister. As a 
            result, he developed an above average emotional intelligence 
            cultivated only by a woman’s touch. Being the only man in 
            the house also meant he had to grow faster than his age to 
            protect himself and his two favourite ladies. This kind of 
            responsibility also made him adopt the mantra, “defend yourself 
            my any means necessary” and some aggressive and sometimes 
            ethically questionable business practices.</p>
        <p>With success, comes enemies. Shepherd is a controversial young 
             man, he’s known to make politically unfashionable and unpopular 
            statements in interviews, “speaking my mind” he calls it. That 
            earned him a lot of haters who are not as dangerous as the 
            trifactor problem he’s facing: politicians, unionists and taxi 
            bosses. They are fuelled by the potential disruption posed by 
            Shepherd’s Eye in the transport industry.  </p>
        <p>Despite all his achievements and status if you asked Shepherd to 
            describe himself, he’ll give you a modest answer “A young man 
            with big dreams, in jeans, t-shirts and vintage shoes”.</p>

    <h3>Changing Technology and the Spread of Internet Culture</h3>

    <p>Author: Khutso Nkadimeng</p>

    <P>The internet as we know it today is a result of many important 
        technological breakthroughs. The foundation of the underlying 
        infrastructure was laid over fifty-one years ago as ARPANET, a 
        United States Department of Defence network connecting universities 
        and research facilities in order to promote sharing of information. 
        I was also meant to enable quick communication between the researchers 
        in order to give the US an edge over the Soviet Union and other 
        enemies. Survival is fundamental to human nature, and so is 
        dominance and that is what drove the technology behind the internet. 
        Human nature did not stop in the 60s or 70s to shape the internet 
        but continues to this day. Our need to communicate gave rise to 
        social networks and dating sites. We want freedom, that lead to 
        blockchain and we always want to enhance ourselves, hence we cannot 
        stop working on artificial intelligence. </P>
    <h4>Social Media</h4>
    <p>Social networks emerged from the development of the World Wide 
        Web and form a big part of our lives and culture today. A 
        message that would take big media conglomerates and millions 
        of Rands to spread takes one person with just a smartphone to 
        reach millions of people across the world. This is how the Arab 
        Spring took over the Arab world, is how Greta Thunberg mobilised 
        millions of people against global warming and how Fees Must Fall 
        swept the entire country and parts of the world. Social media 
        gave power to creatives more than any other medium in history, 
        we see YouTube celebrities, Instegram influencers and eCommerce 
        entrepreneurs everywhere. But this kind of power also brings 
        challenges.</p>
    <p>Fake News is a fast-growing industry leveraging the power of 
        social media to influence elections and manipulate public 
        opinion. Self-esteem is built and destroyed online because 
        it is now linked with a number of likes and reactions. 
        Cyberbullying is on the rise and so is depression. Swiping 
        right could mean a potential lover or being trafficked. That is 
        all dark and frightening but at least we get to have memes.</p>
    <h4>Artificial Intelligence  </h4>
    <p>Geoffrey Hinton, a psychologist and computer scientist set out 
        to model the human brain and, in the process, he pioneered one 
        of the most powerful technologies, Artificial Intelligence. 
        A.I is now on the rise because of two other technologies 
        developed earlier: Microprocessors for computation and the 
        Internet of training data. </p>
    <p>Algorithms capable of learning now make our Google searches 
        efficient, YouTube video suggestions match what we like to 
        watch, Facebook gives us friend suggestions of people we 
        actually want to invite, Twitter feed is only filled with 
        posts from the people we like and what is trending, Amazon 
        show us what we did not know we want to buy but we do. On the 
        flip side, this big companies know more about us than we do 
        about ourselves, we sold our privacy at a very low price. 
        A.I is also used for Deep Fakes, a fake so good it looks real. 
        A fake video of a politician calling for arms can easily start 
        a war. A fake pornographic video of any individual can ruin 
        their lives forever.</p>
    <h4>Blockchain</h4>
    <p>An unknown but legendary figure in the rise of blockchain 
        technology is Satoshi Nakamoto, the developer of cryptocurrency 
        Bitcoin and the first blockchain database. Nakamoto’s creation 
        was in response to the 2008 global market crash which resulted in 
        many people losing faith in the government and financial institutions. 
        Decentralisation is becoming more popular as many people are 
        becoming more concerned with the power held by few companies 
        such as Facebook and organisations such as the NSA. </p>
    <p>People want to regain their privacy, and blockchain companies 
        promise just that with companies such as DTube providing 
        decentralised video sharing networks aimed at YouTube. 
        This technology will play a major role in the future of 
        the internet. </p>
