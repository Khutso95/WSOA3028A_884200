            <p>
              I aim to make an interesting, realistic and relatable character, who
              like many people is shaped by their relationships, environment and
              history. My character and I share a few similarities; we are both from
              rural areas, we moved to the city after completing matric and enrolled
              in engineering. Where you are from, where you are now and what you do
              shapes a lot of who are. Creating these parallels allows me to know what
              experiences my character is realistically likely to have even though
              they are different from mine. I chose for him to work within the
              technology space because it's a sector I am hugely interested in, this
              way I am likely going to have enough background to make hypotheticals
              and enough energy to research them.
            </p>
            <h4>Business and political Influence</h4>
            <p>
              In my pursuit for realism, I have drawn inspiration from companies such
              as Tesla Motors, Google and Mobiliye to create my character’s company,
              Shepherd’s Eye. I rely on the current political climate in South Africa,
              the taxi industry and media culture to find the best possible reaction
              and opposition to Shepherd and his ideas.
            </p>
            <p>
              My character is an entrepreneur operating in a tough political
              environment, to navigate through it, he studies Adam Smith and Niccolò
              Machiavelli. These two men are hated by anti-capitalists and idealists
              respectively and I chose their influence because I believe they were
              right about how the economy and politics work. Self-interest and
              Self-preservation are the driving forces behind how the world works.

              “It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker
              that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own
              interest.”-Adam Smith
            </p>
            <p>
              "The lion cannot protect himself from traps, and the fox cannot defend
              himself from wolves. One must, therefore, be a fox to recognize traps,
              and a lion to frighten wolves."- Niccolò Machiavelli
            </p>
            <h4>Family history legal problems</h4>
            <p>
              Shepherd is in many ways like his parents and in many ways very
              different to them. I think this is true for many people. I chose to make
              him fatherless because I wanted to make his life imperfect, I wanted him
              to have a desire to connect with a man he never really knew. Our country
              is full of absent fathers, but I want to display the strength and love
              of the mothers who are left behind.
