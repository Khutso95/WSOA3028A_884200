    <h3>Character Design Rationale</h3>

      <p>
        I aim to make an interesting, realistic and relatable character, who
        like many people is shaped by their relationships, environment and
        history. My character and I share a few similarities; we are both from
        rural areas, we moved to the city after completing matric and enrolled
        in engineering. Where you are from, where you are now and what you do
        shapes a lot of who are. Creating these parallels allows me to know what
        experiences my character is realistically likely to have even though
        they are different from mine. I chose for him to work within the
        technology space because it's a sector I am hugely interested in, this
        way I am likely going to have enough background to make hypotheticals
        and enough energy to research them.
      </p>
      <h4>Business and political Influence</h4>
      <p>
        In my pursuit for realism, I have drawn inspiration from companies such
        as Tesla Motors, Google and Mobiliye to create my character’s company,
        Shepherd’s Eye. I rely on the current political climate in South Africa,
        the taxi industry and media culture to find the best possible reaction
        and opposition to Shepherd and his ideas.
      </p>
      <p>
        My character is an entrepreneur operating in a tough political
        environment, to navigate through it, he studies Adam Smith and Niccolò
        Machiavelli. These two men are hated by anti-capitalists and idealists
        respectively and I chose their influence because I believe they were
        right about how the economy and politics work. Self-interest and
        Self-preservation are the driving forces behind how the world works.

        “It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker
        that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own
        interest.”-Adam Smith
      </p>
      <p>
        "The lion cannot protect himself from traps, and the fox cannot defend
        himself from wolves. One must, therefore, be a fox to recognize traps,
        and a lion to frighten wolves."- Niccolò Machiavelli
      </p>
      <h4>Family history legal problems</h4>
      <p>
        Shepherd is many ways like his parents and in many ways very different
        to them. I think this is true for many people. I chose to make him
        fatherless because I wanted to make his life imperfect, I wanted him to
        have a desire to connect with a man he never really knew. Our country is
        full of absent fathers, but I want to display the strength and love of
        the mothers who left behind.
