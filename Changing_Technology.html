    <h3>Changing Technology and the Spread of Internet Culture</h3>

        The internet as we know it today is a result of many important
        technological breakthroughs. The foundation of the underlying
        infrastructure was laid over fifty-one years ago as ARPANET, a United
        States Department of Defence network connecting universities and
        research facilities in order to promote sharing of information. I was
        also meant to enable quick communication between the researchers in
        order to give the US an edge over the Soviet Union and other enemies.
        Survival is fundamental to human nature, and so is dominance and that is
        what drove the technology behind the internet. Human nature did not stop
        in the 60s or 70s to shape the internet but continues to this day. Our
        need to communicate gave rise to social networks and dating sites. We
        want freedom, that lead to blockchain and we always want to enhance
        ourselves, hence we cannot stop working on artificial intelligence.
      </p>
      <h4>Social Media</h4>
      <p>
        Social networks emerged from the development of the World Wide Web and
        form a big part of our lives and culture today. A message that would
        take big media conglomerates and millions of Rands to spread takes one
        person with just a smartphone to reach millions of people across the
        world. This is how the Arab Spring took over the Arab world, is how
        Greta Thunberg mobilised millions of people against global warming and
        how Fees Must Fall swept the entire country and parts of the world.
        Social media gave power to creatives more than any other medium in
        history, we see YouTube celebrities, Instegram influencers and eCommerce
        entrepreneurs everywhere. But this kind of power also brings challenges.
      </p>
      <p>
        Fake News is a fast-growing industry leveraging the power of social
        media to influence elections and manipulate public opinion. Self-esteem
        is built and destroyed online because it is now linked with a number of
        likes and reactions. Cyberbullying is on the rise and so is depression.
        Swiping right could mean a potential lover or being trafficked. That is
        all dark and frightening but at least we get to have memes.
      </p>
      <h4>Artificial Intelligence</h4>
      <p>
        Geoffrey Hinton, a psychologist and computer scientist set out to model
        the human brain and, in the process, he pioneered one of the most
        powerful technologies, Artificial Intelligence. A.I is now on the rise
        because of two other technologies developed earlier: Microprocessors for
        computation and the Internet of training data.
      </p>
      <p>
        Algorithms capable of learning now make our Google searches efficient,
        YouTube video suggestions match what we like to watch, Facebook gives us
        friend suggestions of people we actually want to invite, Twitter feed is
        only filled with posts from the people we like and what is trending,
        Amazon show us what we did not know we want to buy but we do. On the
        flip side, this big companies know more about us than we do about
        ourselves, we sold our privacy at a very low price. A.I is also used for
        Deep Fakes, a fake so good it looks real. A fake video of a politician
        calling for arms can easily start a war. A fake pornographic video of
        any individual can ruin their lives forever.
      </p>
      <h4>Blockchain</h4>
      <p>
        An unknown but legendary figure in the rise of blockchain technology is
        Satoshi Nakamoto, the developer of cryptocurrency Bitcoin and the first
        blockchain database. Nakamotoâ€™s creation was in response to the 2008
        global market crash which resulted in many people losing faith in the
        government and financial institutions. Decentralisation is becoming more
        popular as many people are becoming more concerned with the power held
        by few companies such as Facebook and organisations such as the NSA.
      </p>
      <p>
        People want to regain their privacy, and blockchain companies promise
        just that with companies such as DTube providing decentralised video
        sharing networks aimed at YouTube. This technology will play a major
        role in the future of the internet.
