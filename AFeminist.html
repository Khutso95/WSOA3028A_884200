            <h2>A Feminist Reflection on Making A Feminist Internet in Africa </h2>
            <article>

                <img src="images/Feminism1.jpeg" alt="Women workin" />
                <p>By Sanet Witbooi</p>
                <p>27 Jun 2020</p>

                <p>I believe the viewpoints that are presented by Sheena Magenya <a href="https://www.genderit.org/editorial/making-feminist-internet-africa-why-internet-needs-african-feminists-and-feminisms" target="blank">in this article</a> are multifaceted but converge to the idea
                that a feminist internet may be the solution to a growing crisis of an oppressive internet, false African narratives and
                exclusion of the marginalized during a time when we are turning to the internet as a substitute for face-to-face
                connection.</p>

                <p>The first crucial point that resonates with me is that feminism is needed to counter the idea that technology levels
                the playing field for all. On a continent marred by deep inequalities, it is absurd to assume that because we can no
                longer physically see the inequality it vanishes once we enter a virtual world. Yet, people are being required to
                continue with business as usual on the internet we do not all have access to through technology that is a luxury many of
                us cannot afford. A brazen example of this is the shift to online learning in South African schools and universities.
                The pandemic has exposed the basic lack of access to technology and the internet for students which they now have to
                rely on to receive their education. These struggles are not being met with complete comprehension. In fact, many cases
                slip through the cracks while others are met with tone-deaf responses.</p>
                
                <p>Another imperative point the article highlights is the abusive nature of the internet, especially in African spaces
                where legislation or more local governance is not fully established to keep internet users safe who are more prone to
                receiving hate because of their differences. Since the first Imagine a Feminist Internet meeting in 2014, internet usage
                indeed increased across the continent along with the diversity online. However, it cannot be ignored that it also came
                with increased accounts of gender-based violence and human rights violations. People are being pointed to an internet
                that does not have compassion for diversity and by doing so we are risking creating a post-quarantine society that is
                more conservative while others are less intolerant. A feminist internet fights this growing darkness by shining a light
                on the unjust and bringing to the forefront those who have been sidelined.</p>

                <p>Along with Chimamanda Adichi, a self-proclaimed feminist, stands Lebogang Mashile- a South African poet who
                unapologetically calls out the injustices she witnesses. In her poem ABCs, she speaks about the untold stories of
                Africans "who'll rhyme without pens, And perform without a stage". Who similarly highlights the dangers of telling a
                one-dimensional story of a people who are depicted by the world as less capable than and through the perpetuation of the
                internet, can come to see themselves like that too. She aptly demands to know "how it’s possible for people who walk on
                gold to not know how to read”. When it comes to technology and innovation, Africa is positioned as a beneficiary of
                technology not innovators of it, all while Africa has been making groundbreaking contributions throughout history. And
                like with their resources, much is taken but little is returned.</p>

                <p>The aim of creating a feminist internet is to create a true and more positive representation of Africa, and through
                doing so create a more inclusive space. Feminists are the beacons of justice and equality for those who do not fit into a
                heteronormative society and in so doing seeks justice for the entire continent. Therefore, the transformation of the
                internet should stand to be a reminder that we will not quietly disappear amongst the chaos of an abusive world.</p>
