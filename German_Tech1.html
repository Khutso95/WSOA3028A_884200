                <h4>Why is this coming out now</h4>
                <p>Before going into what exactly happened or if it is true, I must first address why these allegations are coming out now.
                These are critical times for me and my company, and this story has negatively impacted my company’s mission, my
                hardworking and talented team and investor’s confidence. There are four reasons behind this campaign: Marketing, Fear,
                vested interests in my failure and Political Aspirations.</p>

                <h4>Marketing</h4>
                <p>The source cited by the Witwatersrand Post will be releasing a book detailing his life of crime through the publishing
                division of the Witwatersrand Post. They want you to believe that they are the good guys in pursuit of the truth, that
                they are committed to exposing people like me who do not care who they hurt in their quest for wealth. They are counting
                on this controversy to sell as many books as possible. Is it not ironic that they do not care who is getting hurt in the
                process?</p>
                <h4>Fear</h4>
                <p>There is a genuine fear of the technology my company is creating. As responsible engineers, we understand our
                obligations to society, and we are committed to making decisions consistent with public safety and welfare. Everyone can
                clearly see the safety benefits of our vision, but welfare is the problem. What about our jobs? That is what every
                concerned paid driver is asking us. This is a very challenging problem for us to address, and we will be making
                announcements regarding this before our launch, I am excited about the opportunities our platform is going to bring to
                the working class.</p>
                <h4>Vested interests in my failure</h4>
                <p>When autonomous cars hit the road, union lose their members, taxi owners lose their business and politicians lose their
                support and they must also address this problem facing our generation directly. It is no surprise to me that the people
                calling for an investigation into my business and opening cases against me are government officials, taxi owners and
                union leaders.</p>
                <h4>Political Aspirations</h4>
                <p>Kelly Williams, the author of this story is a self-proclaimed Marxist who vowed to defend workers’ rights with her
                mighty pen. But the Witwatersrand Post has become too small a platform for her, she has her eyes set on the secretary’s
                chair of the National Workers Union. If she eliminates the “the greatest threat to job security”, that is how my company
                is described in their circles, then she will certainly secure her position</p>
