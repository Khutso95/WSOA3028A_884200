    <h3>Understanding Digital Information Using Metaphors</h3>

      <p>
        Metaphors are so engrained in how we process digital information that we
        are not even aware that we are using them. The buildings blocks of our
        digital world are programming and mark-up languages which are structured
        using headers, bodies and footers. We build complicated algorithms using
        parent-child relationships to search through trees of data structured in
        private or public forms in object-oriented programming. Bodies, headers,
        footers, parent, child, public, private and languages. That sounds to me
        like a description of a warzone. My point is: these are words we use to
        describe things in our physical world. When it comes to the digital
        world, we use metaphors to simplify complex concepts, to give a sense of
        familiarity and to evoke emotions. I will be exploring those three ideas
        in this article.
      </p>
      <h4>Simplifying Complex Concepts</h4>
      <p>
        I will demonstrate how concepts are simplified with metaphors using a
        branch of computer science, Data Structures and Algorithms. To write
        algorithms, we must understand the arrangement of the data we are trying
        to manipulate. Linked Lists, Trees, Stack and Queues are some examples
        of Abstract Data Structures. I have known since I was a child what
        stacking is, putting things on top of each other and as a programmer
        what I need to know about a Stack is that when I begin unstacking, I
        start at the top. Whatever data I put in last must come out first. That
        sounds basic and that is the point of using metaphors.
      </p>
      <h4>Familiarity</h4>
      <p>
        The Stack example can be used to demonstrate familiarity as well, but I
        will use online shopping instead. Designers of online shops try as hard
        as they can to make everything familiar. When you visit Takealot.com you
        quickly notice they have classed everything into departments: Beauty,
        Groceries, Health and Hygiene and many others. This arrangement
        simplifies things and is also familiar. You do not go to Shoprite
        looking for building materials and while in Shoprite hanging boards
        indicate what each shelve is carrying and online shops want to give that
        same sense. When you are selecting items to buy on Takealot, you use a
        cart, a very familiar tool to shoppers. Online shops also use multiple
        pictures to allow the level of scrutiny normal to customers. If data was
        not a problem, I would add music to my shop for an even better and
        familiar experience.
      </p>
      <h4>Triggering Emotions</h4>
      <p>
        Triggering emotions does not require cutting edge technologies, a simple
        human touch will do and once you add a story to it, it carries a deeper
        meaning. So how do you get a story with a human touch considering the
        short attention span online? Infographics. A creative combination of
        words and pictures does the trick hence the rise of content marketing.
        Different styling can also be used to express the nature of a site, a
        minimalistic green vegan website will most likely attract more traffic
        than one with caged chickens in the background.
