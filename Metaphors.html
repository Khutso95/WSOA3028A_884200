            <h3>Understanding Digital Information Using Metaphors</h3>

              <p>
                Metaphors are so engrained in how we process digital information that we
                are not even aware that we are using them. The buildings blocks of our
                digital world are programming and mark-up languages which are structured
                using headers, bodies and footers. We build complicated algorithms using
                parent-child relationships to search through trees of data structured in
                private or public forms in object-oriented programming. Bodies, headers,
                footers, parent, child, public, private and languages. That sounds to me
                like a description of a warzone. My point is: these are words we use to
                describe things in our physical world. When it comes to the digital
                world, we use metaphors to simplify complex concepts, to give a sense of
                familiarity and to evoke emotions. I will be exploring those three ideas
                in this article.
              </p>
              <h4>Simplifying Complex Concepts</h4>
              <p>
                I will demonstrate how concepts are simplified with metaphors using a
                branch of computer science, Data Structures and Algorithms. To write
                algorithms, we must understand the arrangement of the data we are trying
                to manipulate. Linked Lists, Trees, Stack and Queues are some examples
                of Abstract Data Structures. I have known since I was a child what
                stacking is, putting things on top of each other and as a programmer
                what I need to know about a Stack is that when I begin unstacking, I
                start at the top. Whatever data I put in last must come out first. That
                sounds basic and that is the point of using metaphors.
              </p>
              <h4>Familiarity</h4>
              <p>
                The Stack example can be used to demonstrate familiarity as well, but I
                will use online shopping instead. Designers of online shops try as hard
                as they can to make everything familiar. When you visit Takealot.com you
                quickly notice they have classed everything into departments: Beauty,
                Groceries, Health and Hygiene and many others. This arrangement
                simplifies things and is also familiar. You do not go to Shoprite
                looking for building materials and while in Shoprite hanging boards
                indicate what each shelve is carrying and online shops want to give that
                same sense. When you are selecting items to buy on Takealot, you use a
                cart, a very familiar tool to shoppers. Online shops also use multiple
                pictures to allow the level of scrutiny normal to customers. If data was
                not a problem, I would add music to my shop for an even better and
                familiar experience.
              </p>
              <h4>Triggering Emotions</h4>
              <p>
                Triggering emotions does not require cutting edge technologies, a simple
                human touch will do and once you add a story to it, it carries a deeper
                meaning. So how do you get a story with a human touch considering the
                short attention span online? Infographics. A creative combination of
                words and pictures does the trick hence the rise of content marketing.
                Different styling can also be used to express the nature of a site, a
                minimalistic green vegan website will most likely attract more traffic
                than one with caged chickens in the background.
