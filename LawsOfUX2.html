            <h3>Laws of UX: Tesla Motors (2 of 3)</h3>
            <article>

              <p>
                In this part two of the series, I continue to look at the Laws of User
                Experience crated by Jon Yablonski. and how they apply to Tesla Inc.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Law of Pragnanz</strong>:People will perceive and interpret
                ambiguous or complex images as the simplest form possible because it is
                the interpretation that requires the least cognitive effort of us.
              </p>
              <p>
                Some analysts and drivers just summarise Tesla as an iPhone on wheels.
                This is largely due to the seamless integration between its hardware and
                software as well its production line’s vertical integration. Just like
                smartphones, Tesla cars have over-the-air updates, this is perhaps one
                of the leading competitive advantages Tesla has over petrol cars. You
                update your car overnight and the next day your acceleration is faster,
                the breaks are better, the battery last longer, so to explain all these,
                a phone was used as a metaphor.
              </p>
              <p>
                An even more interesting case is that of investors and financial
                analysts. From what perspective do you analyse Tesla? Is it a car
                company? Is it a technology company? Is it a battery/energy company?
                Most bears picked an auto company and looked at it like they would Ford
                or BMW but one of the most bullish Tesla shareholder Cathie Woods
                classifies Tesla as an autonomous taxi company, essentially, a major
                threat to ride-sharing companies such as Uber and Lyft.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Tesler’s Law</strong>: Tesler's Law, also known as The Law of
                Conservation of Complexity, states that for any system there is a
                certain amount of complexity which cannot be reduced.
              </p>
              <p>
                Tesla CEO Elon Musk wanted his factory to be as futuristic as his cars,
                so he decided to automate everything he could to make his company's
                first mass-production car, the Model 3. It turns out that certain tasks
                which come intuitively to humans are extremely difficult for machines.
                This miscalculation resulted in what is now known as Tesla's Production
                Hell. Production of complicated machines will likely remain a
                collaboration between humans and machines. But what does this have to
                with drivers? Well, deliveries were delayed, and customers were not
                happy at all.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Von Restorff Effect</strong>: The Von Restorff effect, also
                known as The Isolation Effect, predicts that when multiple similar
                objects are present, the one that differs from the rest is most likely
                to be remembered.
              </p>
              <p>
                Tesla is one of the most innovative companies in the world and with
                everything they have put into the car, from what I gather: Nothing beats
                the acceleration in Ludicrous mode.
