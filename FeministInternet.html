            <h3>Making a Feminist Internet in Africa – A reflection</h3>

                <p>Author: Khutso Nkadimeng</p>
                <p>26 Jun 2020</p>

                <p>When economist Dr Thomas Sowell was asked why he believed politics was not the vehicle through which most of the
                economic problems facing the black community could be solved, he said, and I paraphrase, politics like many things has
                things it can do and things it cannot do. As someone who bought into the dream of the internet and its promise for
                equality and democratisation of sectors previously reserved for a select few, I have come to a similar conclusion, the
                internet, like many things, it has things it can do and things it cannot do. I had too much faith in it. In this post, I
                will be reflecting on Sheena Magenya’s <a href="https://www.genderit.org/editorial/making-feminist-internet-africa-why-internet-needs-african-feminists-and-feminisms"
                    target="blank">article</a> of the same title and the <a href="AFeminist.html" target="blank">Witwatersrand Post’s Sanet Witbooi reaction</a> 
                to it.</p>
                <h4>Access</h4>
                <p>“And therein lies the problem: presenting the internet as a solution to a social problem, as some kind of communication
                silver bullet that imagines an equality of access, use and representation on the internet which is false”</p>
                
                <p>Dr Ruha Benjamin cautions against the same issue, an assumption that a social problem can be solved through technology.
                The problem of access to the internet and technology is yet another example of government failure, is a problem we are
                witnessing live in high definition with a shift to online learning as highlighted by Sanet.</p>

                <h4>Contribution and Representation</h4>

                <p>Access is hardly the only problem. The 15 million internet user increase in four years in Kenya and its subsequent
                results can be summarised with a conclusion from Mark Graham, “Connecting the previously disconnected in order to solve
                the digital divides is undoubtedly only part of the solution. Equally important are interrelated issues of literacy and
                education, digital architecture, governance of online communities and platforms, cultural, religious, gendered, and
                other socially constructed barriers, politics and political interference, and language” [2]</p>

                <p>I would argue that a strong, deliberate, and active feminist movement will play a huge role in addressing the problems
                stated by Graham. African women have, throughout history been the most marginalised group, there is no one better suited
                for “setting old and current scores straight online” [1]. This is supported by the argument made in the paper on digital
                hegemonies [3], that a strong publishing industry and culture of high-quality research tend to produce more online
                presence, we need more African females in those areas.</p>

                <h4>Legislation</h4>
                
                <p>The problem of abuse and gender-based violence online requires an immediate solution. I suggest a similar approach taken
                in racism cases such as the one of Adam Catzavelos. The mandate of Equality Court and Sexual Offences Court must
                increase to online incidents.</p>

                <h4>Innovation</h4>

                <p>Sheena presents a generalisation that dominates the internet about African tech innovation, that “Our innovations are
                responses to famine, drought, disease and death”. Although she makes this point to caution against the dangers of a
                single story, I believe what drives African tech innovation in this context is not new and should be embraced by those
                of us in positions to do anything about it. Computer Science as pioneered by Alan Turing was in response to the death
                threat posed by Nazi Germany. The lack of banking infrastructure in Africa is what propelled the continent to the top in
                cashless transaction technologies.</p>

                <p>In conclusion, I believe making a feminist internet will address many of the problems faced by all Africans.</p>
