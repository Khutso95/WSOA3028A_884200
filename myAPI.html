                <h4>Why this API?</h4>
                <p>I have written a few articles about the ethical concerns surrounding computer vision. I wanted to explore this idea
                further, hence my API choice face-api.js, <a href="https://itnext.io/face-api-js-javascript-api-for-face-recognition-in-the-browser-with-tensorflow-js-bcc2a6c4cf07" target="blank">“a javascript module, built on top of tensorflow.js core, which implements
                several CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks) to solve face detection, face recognition and face landmark detection,
                optimized for the web and for mobile devices.”</a></p>

                <p>One study I read <a href="CV_Ethical_Concerns.html" target="blank">found a 34.7% error rate in classifying dark-skinned females and 0.8% error rate in classifying
                light-skinned males</a>, this fact also supported by the findings of the <a href="CV_Ethical_Concerns2.html" target="blank">National Institute of Standards and Technology in
                the United States</a> which came to similar conclusions after testing 189 face recognition algorithms formed the basis of
                my initial plans with this API. I devised the most unscientific scientific study in this subject, I wanted to put
                together twenty-five pictures of black females and the same number of white male and then run this algorithm to see if
                there was going to be discrepancies. There are obviously many academic alarms going off when reading this, however, it
                was a good start. Flawed as it may sound, the tests would have been equally flawed in both test cases, therefore my
                hypothesis would stand. However, this approach failed once I realised how much time it was taking, so I simplified my
                work to a simple live stream that detects facial expressions and predicts the age of the subject.</p>
                
                <h4>Impact on my site</h4>
                <br>
                <p>This API’s impact on my site has largely been negative:</p>
                <br>
                <p>1. I failed to use it in a way that would be the most coherent for my site. This is largely because my initial plans for
                it were not successful. Consequently, its feature on my site that is useful for research and learning purposes which are
                two very important parts of this course, but it does not improve the user’s experience, it does the opposite.</p>
                <br>
                <p>2. It is the most unstable and untested part of my website; it is not properly optimised for mobile use when it comes to
                screen size even though it works.</p>
                <br>
                <p>3. It feels like a separate project to mine at the same time it fits perfectly to my website. It depends entirely on
                perspective. I believe I</p>
                <br>
                <p>4. The best part about this is the part that cannot be marked, I learned something new.</p>

                <h4>Why was it necessary for my site?</h4>
                <p>The theme and direction of my website are well cultivated with direct links between my posts and my character. <a href="Biography.html" target="blank">My
                character</a> is an entrepreneur building self-driving car capabilities and computer vision technology with personal links
                to the military. He has expressed <a href="EthicalConcerns.html" target="blank">concerns</a> over the recent developments in the face recognition sector involving <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/microsoft-will-stop-selling-facial-recognition-software-to-police-2020-06-11" target="blank">IBM,
                Microsoft, and Amazon.</a> Although my initial idea was to focus more on the automation of jobs, I ended up in this
                controversial section of our tech world. The only other API that would be better suited for this scenario would YOLO or
                similar computer vision products, otherwise, this was the best choice given the reasons.</p>
                <h4>Alternatives</h4>
                <p>The core of this API is tensorflow.js and it was the one alternative I considered before choosing this one. The major
                reason why I did not use tensorflow is that I either had to have in-depth knowledge or use a second API which was
                prohibited in this assignment. But why tensorflow or face-api? This is simply because they were built for the browser
                and use JavaScript</p>
                <h4>Conclusion</h4>
                <p>It has been a privilege.</p>
