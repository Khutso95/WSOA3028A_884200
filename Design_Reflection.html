                <h4>Character growth</h4>

                <p>To grow my character, I have decided to create chaos around him at the most critical time of his company. I have done
                this by including the Press section, my research shows that a lot of people have a Featured section in their websites
                where they list different publications that featured them, typically, these are positive interviews or articles on their
                work. I will not follow this norm; the press section will be used to integrate the world around my character and this
                website. This arrangement will allow me to also explore his history, motivation and attitude.</p>
                <h4>Language</h4>

                <p>I use familiar and ordinary language throughout the entire website. This is in part because of my language constraints
                and more deliberately, to enable easy consumption of my content. I try being crafty in how I arrange the words for
                entertainment purposes, and I break a lot of material into smaller pieces to make them easy to read.</p>
                <p>Grammar remains a major problem to me, to mitigate this I used Grammarly and even after that a few friends reviewing my
                work still found errors. So, I am working under the assumption that I still have a lot of errors to correct.</p>
                <h4>UX</h4>
                <p>The direction I took from the beginning has not changed, I intend to maintain a minimalistic and responsive website. I
                also want to have a progress bar for readers.</p>
                <p>I battled with the rationale behind the back button, the reason being that most browsers and devices already provide
                such buttons. But a few reviews were enough to show that back buttons are widely used, and some browsers and iPhones may
                not have them, so I included them for redundancy. I must say, the site felt better after including them. Now they feel
                necessary.</p>
                <p>Going forward I will be using Laws of UX and the Nielsen Norman Group as guides for my UX design.</p>

                <h4>Accessibility</h4>
                <p>I plan to do more research into how to make my site bot friendly, I am also using simple language to accommodate
                different readers. I intend to use MDN Speech API to give users an option to listen to every post.</p>
