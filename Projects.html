        Inconvenience, insults and insecurity, that’s what commuters pay for to
        get off after robot in a taxi. If reckless driving was an Olympic sport,
        there would gold medals hanging on a rear-view mirror of every taxi in
        South Africa. Taking a taxi might sound like a very normal thing in any
        society, but this is a deadly undertaking in the city of Johannesburg, a
        problem I intend to eliminate.
      </p>
      <p>
        Project Noord is an ambitious project by my company Shepherd’s Eye. We
        have been working on it for over 5 years and personally have been
        working on it for over 15 years. The aim of the project is to make an
        autonomous minibus taxi and create a true freedom of movement. We
        currently have sensors and specialised computers in 3000 taxis commuting
        from Noord Taxi Rank in Johannesburg to every part of the country.
      </p>

        We are inspired by the human eye and the only sensor close enough is a
        camera, which is why cameras are the major sensors in our system. Using
        cameras and artificial intelligence, we can see objects and distinguish
        them in a way that lidar would not, lidar also required us to build a 3D
        map of our roads. This would mean less processing power, but it would
        also mean our cars would be confused if a road was reconstructed or
        worse, its full of plastics. We use radar for long distance calculations
        and most advance night vision technology there is.
      </p>

        Our taxis have navigation difficulties under bad weather conditions,
        since South Africa does not have a lot of snow, we have been putting
        more effort into rainy days and progress has been made. I am very
        excited about this project, it’s a revolution waiting to happen, and I
        will be releasing technical specifications in the next coming weeks.
