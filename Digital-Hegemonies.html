            <h3>Digital Hegemonies: The Localness of Search Results - A Reflection</h3>
            <article>
                <p>Author: Khutso Nkadimeng</p>
                <p>05 Jun 2020</p>
                <img src="images/Google-Apple.jpeg" alt="Google" />

                <p>The power of media and its use is well documented, those who control information and its distribution, control the
                world. Although large corporations still heavily influence public opinion, access to their information and that of the
                rest of the world has a new gatekeeper, Google, the world's largest search engine. This reflection will not examine the
                research methodologies employed in the titled paper. It is a personal take on the conclusion and opinions supported by
                personal experience.</p>

                <p>Dr Ruha Benjamin cautions against the fertilized entrepreneurial spirit when confronted with these technological
                problems [2]. I hypothesise that fixing the problem of access and connectivity will address the issue of local
                contribution to different spheres of the internet. It never occurred to me that there may be other factors at play that
                makes it difficult for me to find my family’s praise poem from a reputable online source and economist Dr Thomas Sowell
                alludes to it many of his books, culture. “Thus, we suggest that socioeconomic systems that produce high-quality
                research also tend to produce highly visible online content” [1]. Wealthy countries with high levels of connections tend
                to have more locally produced content, but a strong publishing industry, traditional or academic plays a big role [1].</p>

                <p>So, in the spirit of Dr Benjamin’s appeal to us to join movements, organisations and activists currently addressing
                technological problems faced by different communities, as students we must play our part in contributing to knowledge
                and addressing the main problems highlighted by Digital Hegemonies: Connectivity, Weak or non-existent publishing
                industry and culture, Lack of participation and Search Engines.</p>

                <h4>Connectivity</h4>
                <p>The problem of connectivity is the one I firmly believe will be solved by entrepreneurialism. I believe this so much
                that I attempted to build a wireless mesh network around my community to address the problems of a poor connection and
                high cost. Once traditional television can be economically rivalled by streaming, there will be huge changes in how
                information is produced consumed in the country.</p>

                <h4>Weak or non-existent publishing industry and culture</h4>

                <p>South African universities are some of the leading research institutions in Africa and we have a relatively free and
                active press, consequently, a lot of information is being produced. But how much of it is accessible to an average
                person? How much of it is online and search optimised? There are also crucial pieces of our history dying with our
                elders, we must find ways to share and critique them.</p>

                <h4>Lack of participation</h4>

                <p>When constructing a culture of knowledge production, we must be careful not to build systems with gender, academic,
                economic or any bias. This is a major reason for the apparent lack of participation in the Global South,</p>

                <h4>Search Engines</h4>
                <p>Search engines are the new information pipelines “The importance of these new mediators is observable in the industry of
                search engine optimization (SEO), which reflects how these tools are now at the core of the media landscape,
                representing a considerable portion of global advertising markets.”[1]</p>

                <p>We must understand how engines work and optimise our information for them. We must also recognise the power they possess
                and the danger they pose to our society, deciding on which information gets distribute is too much power, even for an
                algorithm, “since the company’s creation in 1998, Google’s algorithms have tended to favour highly central Web content:
                Pages linked to by a lot of other pages are prioritized, and those largely ignored are demoted in the rankings. This
                creates a worrying situation whereby it becomes difficult for those on the information peripheries to break out of their
                digital marginality.”</p>
