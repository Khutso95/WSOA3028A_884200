            <h3>Laws of UX: Tesla Motors (3 of 3)</h3>

              <p>
                I will conclude this series based loosely on the Gestalt Laws of
                Grouping.
              </p>
              <p>
                To appreciate the impact of Tesla on its users you might want to check
                its advertising budget: the company spends zero dollars on paid
                advertising, the drivers are doing that free of charge. The products
                were designed with the user in mind, from buying the car to parking it
                in their garages.
              </p>
              <h4>Good Cause</h4>
              <p>
                Consumer trends change all the time and global warming is one of the
                major discussions of our time. Tesla is leveraging this by giving its
                customers a feeling of not only driving a good car but also saving the
                planet.
              </p>
              <h4>Buying</h4>
              <img src="images/Tesla order2.png" width="40%" alt="ordering Tesla model 3" />
              <p>
                Traditional carmakers have dealerships and that's where people face very
                insisting salesmen. This is also how car makers make profits through
                parts and service. Tesla cars do not need an oil change or thousands of
                parts, so a dealership is not necessary. Customers buy online like they
                do an iPhone and the car. This is very convenient and economical.
              </p>
              <h4>Autopilot</h4>
              <p>
                Tesla has one of the most advanced driver assistance systems and drivers
                have found many uses for it. One couple made a porn video in a
                self-driving Tesla and Elon Musk responded to it in a tweet “Turns out
                there’s more ways to use Autopilot than we imagined”. Come on Musk!
              </p>
              <h4>Charging Network</h4>
              <img src="images/tesla-charger2.jpeg" width="40%" alt="Tesla charging network" />
              <p>
                The reason people don't worry about driving a car with an empty tank is
                that there is a petrol station on the nearby corner. You would not take
                chance with a battery car, so Tesla had to build a countrywide charging
                network to simplify long-distance trips for its drivers.
              </p>
              <p>
                All these factors combined, and many others make up the Tesla user
                experience. I believe with a better understanding UX, Tesla will make a
                good case study.
