        Shepherd’s Eye, a fictional company founded by my character Shepherd
        Modisha was inspired in part by an Israeli driving assistance software
        developing company
        <a href="https://www.mobileye.com/" target="_blank">Mobiliye</a>, and
        American electric car maker
        <a href="https://www.tesla.com/" target="_blank">Tesla Inc</a>. To
        understand the Laws of User Experience created by Jon Yablonski, I used
        Tesla Inc as a case study, my choice was influenced by the laws of
        Connectedness and Similarity, that what I put up on this site must be
        connected. My perspective was guided by
        <a

        UX summary from Nielsen Norman Group: "User experience" encompasses all
        aspects of the end-users interaction with the company, its services, and
        its products [1].

      <p>
        <strong>Aesthetic Usability Effect</strong>: Users often perceive
        aesthetically pleasing design as design that’s more usable.
      </p>
      <p>
        Electric vehicles were always known to be ugly cars with low range and
        stood no chance against internal combustion engine cars. What Tesla did
        was to design an aesthetically pleasing high-performance car with
        long-range. Just by looking at a Tesla Model S, you will be convinced
        you can take on any BMW.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Fitts Law</strong>: The time to acquire a target is a function
        of the distance to and size of the target.
      </p>

      <p>
        To free drivers from a dashboard full of old clunky buttons, Tesla
        decided to centralise all controls from radio to sunroof using their
        signature giant screen. To give you some perspective, the screen is at
        least the size of our school-issued Dell Inspiron laptops. If you have
        driven a car, you know the feel and position of your volume button and
        can use it without looking, but as a smartphone user I can assure you,
        it is very difficult to use a slider without a quick peek and that is
        unacceptable for a driver. The size of the screen is meant to mitigate
        that by amplifying all icons and buttons. It is also worth noting that
        Tesla is designing their cars to be fully autonomous in future, this
        huge screen will eventually be used purely for entertainment purposes.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Jakob’s Law</strong>: Users spend most of their time on other
        sites. This means that users prefer your site to work the same way as
        all the other sites they already know.
      </p>

        />
        <br />
        Tesla Motors has always been a polarising company, tech enthusiasts made
        an inspiring bull case, but the bears made a reasonable case using
        proven auto industry models. Tesla stock eventually became the most
        shorted in history, but its fans continued to rally behind it. What no
        one expected was a division among its most loyal fans, that was because
        Tesla to shift radically from the norm when they launched their
        Cybertruck.
