            <h3>4IR – The Case of South Africa</h3>
            <article>
                <p>Author: Khutso Nkadimeng</p>

                <p>This reflection is written with an assumption that the reader is familiar with the first three Industrial Revolutions at
                least in broad terms. These three events were characterised by technological, cultural and socioeconomic changes [2].
                Although the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR) has those three features, it is driven mainly by the same technological
                changes of the Third Industrial Revolution. The only major difference is the higher rate of change. The term is
                effective as a marketing and political tool, the only way to benefit from a revolution is to be a revolutionist, it is
                no surprise why government officials and business leaders are pushing this rhetoric.</p>

                <p>4IR is not a revolution [1], it is a term used to define potential changes from a set of technologies that include
                artificial intelligence (AI), autonomous vehicles, 3D printing, biotechnology, 5G, cyber-physical systems, Internet of
                Things, quantum computing, nanotechnology, robotics and industrial internet of Things (IIoT) [1]. “Complex policies have
                proved difficult for South African governments, both their development and implementation”, although still difficult,
                choosing to focus on one of these technologies is more doable [1]. China is the manufacture of the world; India has
                taken a decision long time to focus on technology and business process outsourcing, they now dominate the world’s
                outsourcing market [3]. South Africa should focus on the industrial internet of Things (IIoT).</p>

                <p>Why IIoT? My decision to enrol for BEngSc (Digital Arts) was to address my interest in engineering and art, Digital Arts
                was the only course combining the two. IIoT will address some major obstacles to economic growth in South Africa.</p>

                <h4>1. Infrastructure development.</h4>
                <p>Internet is a basic requirement for IIoT and is either inaccessible or very expensive in South Africa. Addressing this
                problem will have a positive domino effect.</p>

                <h4>2. Power Generation.</h4>

                <p>For South Africa to become a go-to supplier or service provider of the world, there needs to a stable supply of power.
                The neighbouring countries are already customers. A surplus of electricity can be sold to more African countries. Power
                shortage is one of the biggest opportunities in Africa, and a big enough capacity to address it will result in many job
                opportunities.</p>
                <h4>3. Education.</h4>
                <p>Skilled labour is one of the reasons why many companies are not bringing manufacturing to South Africa [1]. With IIoT,
                the country can focus on skills in areas like Cybersecurity, Cloud Computing, Data Analytics, industrial Software and
                Hardware production.</p>

                <h4>4. Policy Certainty.</h4>
                <p>“In South Africa, the legal and policy frameworks for infrastructure have been problematic, with changes being made
                slowly, with poor quality drafting and inadequate parliamentary scrutiny of legislation, weak regulation, and excessive
                reliance on poorly controlled and financed state-owned enterprises” [1]. Many investors have in most cases stated policy
                uncertainty as a major reason why they are not investing in South Africa. “Even MTN uses Mauritius as the base for its
                holding company for African assets and tax reduction.” [1]. A clear direction from the government will also inform private enterprise on what problems to address and opportunities
                pursue. The government must change its ‘nanny state’ [1] attitude towards business and focus on being a developmental
                state.</p>

                <p>In conclusion, focusing on just IIoT, South Africa will address four major problems simultaneously and be able to
                industrialise the economy more with the current classes of workers in the country all included some part of the value
                chain from mining to processing, manufacturing to software as a service. Now that would be a true revolution.</p>
