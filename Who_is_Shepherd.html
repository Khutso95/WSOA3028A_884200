      <h3>Who is Shepherd</h3>

        Shepherd Modisha is an angel investor and founder of Shepherd’s Eye, a
        company focused on developing autonomous vehicles and computer vision
        technologies. This project is a long-life mission inspired by tragic
        loss of his father to a car accident 14 years ago.
      </p>
      <p>
        Born on the 7th of April 1992, Shepherd is an eccentric and ambitious
        tech entrepreneur from GaModiša just outside Polokwane in Limpopo.
        Coming from a middle-class family he was exposed to computers at an
        early age, a rare occurrence in his neighbourhood. His entrepreneurial
        and technical abilities showed in his early teen years when he started a
        successful robotics club in high school. After completing his studies in
        Electrical Engineering, he joined forces with his friend to start
        fintech company specialising in artificial intelligence to reduce high
        risk associated with lending money to low income individuals and
        businesses. He sold the company for millions to a big bank before
        founding Shepherd’s Eye
      </p>
      <p>
        Interestingly, Shepherd had a dream of becoming a professional race car
        driver one day. An unlikely hobby given how his father died, but he was
        inspired by street drifters in the townships and idolised Formula One
        champion Michael Schumacher.
      </p>
      <p>
        Dr John Gray says Men Are from Mars and Women Are from Venus in his
        bestseller of the same tittle and in that context, Shepherd has visited
        Venus on multiple occasions. He grew up in a house with two women, his
        mother and sister. As a result, he developed an above average emotional
        intelligence cultivated only by a woman’s touch. Being the only man in
        the house also meant he had to grow faster than his age to protect
        himself and his two favourite ladies. This kind of responsibility also
        made him adopt the mantra, “defend yourself my any means necessary” and
        some aggressive and sometimes ethically questionable business practices.
      </p>
      <p>
        With success, comes enemies. Shepherd is a controversial young man, he’s
        known to make politically unfashionable and unpopular statements in
        interviews, “speaking my mind” he calls it. That earned him a lot of
        haters who are not as dangerous as the trifactor problem he’s facing:
        politicians, unionists and taxi bosses. They are fuelled by the
        potential disruption posed by Shepherd’s Eye in the transport industry.
      </p>
      <p>
        Despite all his achievements and status if you asked Shepherd to
        describe himself, he’ll give you a modest answer “A young man with big
        dreams, in jeans, t-shirts and vintage shoes”.
