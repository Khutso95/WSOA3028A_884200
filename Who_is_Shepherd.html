                Shepherd Modisha is an angel investor and founder of Shepherd’s Eye, a
                company focused on developing autonomous vehicles and computer vision
                technologies. This project is a long-life mission inspired by tragic
                loss of his father to a car accident 14 years ago.
              </p>
              <p>
                Born on the 7th of April 1992, Shepherd is an eccentric and ambitious
                tech entrepreneur from GaModiša just outside Polokwane in Limpopo.
                Coming from a middle-class family he was exposed to computers at an
                early age, a rare occurrence in his neighbourhood. His entrepreneurial
                and technical abilities showed in his early teen years when he started a
                successful robotics club in high school. After completing his studies in
                Electrical Engineering, he joined forces with his friend to start
                fintech company specialising in artificial intelligence to reduce high
                risk associated with lending money to low income individuals and
                businesses. He sold the company for millions to a big bank before
                founding Shepherd’s Eye
              </p>
              <p>
                Interestingly, Shepherd had a dream of becoming a professional race car
                driver one day. An unlikely hobby given how his father died, but he was
                inspired by street drifters in the townships and idolised Formula One
                champion Michael Schumacher.
              </p>
              <p>
                Dr John Gray says Men Are from Mars and Women Are from Venus in his
                bestseller of the same tittle and in that context, Shepherd has visited
                Venus on multiple occasions. He grew up in a house with two women, his
                mother and sister. As a result, he developed an above average emotional
                intelligence cultivated only by a woman’s touch. Being the only man in
                the house also meant he had to grow faster than his age to protect
                himself and his two favourite ladies. This kind of responsibility also
                made him adopt the mantra, “defend yourself my any means necessary” and
                some aggressive and sometimes ethically questionable business practices.
              </p>
              <p>
                With success, comes enemies. Shepherd is a controversial young man, he’s
                known to make politically unfashionable and unpopular statements in
                interviews, “speaking my mind” he calls it. That earned him a lot of
                haters who are not as dangerous as the trifactor problem he’s facing:
                politicians, unionists and taxi bosses. They are fuelled by the
                potential disruption posed by Shepherd’s Eye in the transport industry.
              </p>
              <p>
                Despite all his achievements and status if you asked Shepherd to
                describe himself, he’ll give you a modest answer “A young man with big
                dreams, in jeans, t-shirts and vintage shoes”.
